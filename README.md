A Flask project with ML(Faster R-CNN object detection). 

You upload an image and it responds on a page with the objects that it detects using the Faster R-CNN.

There is also a notebook to use with google colab. The only prerequisites is that you need to upload the files from "static"
and "template" to the designated folders!

P.S: In future endeavors the application will be faster!

Thank you!
